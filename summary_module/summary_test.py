After which further input from the public will not be permitted for legal reasons. Reasons. It is important that if you wish to speak and be heard on a planning matter, now is the time to make representation. And again, once I, the Chairperson, close a public hearing, no further discussion will be allowed. With that read, we'll move to the public hearing portion. The first will be 5.1. That's a development plan amendment. Bylaw 2411, Agricultural Preserve to employment. Can I get a mover and a seconder for that, please? Glenn and Melinda. We have bylaw 2411. This is an application to redesignate land from agricultural preserve to employment. Mr. Bill McGarry, President of Waterside Development Corp. Owner of the property, has made an application for the development plan Amendment on Lot 134, Plan 433 within south within the Southwest section of 2910 4. The applicant is seeking to redesignate the property from agricultural preserve area to employment. Mr. McGarry intends to subdivide the approximate 17.4 acres of land to create additional industrial lots, including an internal municipal road. No conceptual plan was provided to our offices of yet. On November 21, Council had granted first reading of Bylaw 2411 under Resolution 24433. The public hearing was scheduled for the January 23, 2025 meeting. At the onset of the public hearing, a representative From Waterside Development, Mr. Ball, Bob Doolin, had stated that he wanted to postpone the public hearing to a later date and he was awaiting additional information from the Department of Agriculture to be submitted to council within the within or with the public hearing now being reconvened, we had to start the notification process over again. The following persons or departments have received the following notification on the following dates. February 10, the Minister being Municipal and Northern Relations. Also on February 10, the applicants received the notice of public hearing. February 10 was submitted to the surrounding municipalities and planning district. On March 11, the public hearing notices were mailed by regular mail to those surrounding 100 meters of the subject property and those who had signed in. Also at the January February 23rd original public hearing. March 11th public hearing notice were posted at the municipal office, the planning office on the municipal and the municipal website. March 11 Public Hearing Notice was also posted on the subject site. March 13th and 20th there was two publications in the Clipper weekly for this public hearing. This evening Mr. Doolin was speaking about an email that he had received from Michelle Erb from Department of Agriculture and I've only given him a small excerpt of that email. Council has the original and it was also Included in my original package. Ms. Erb had stated, as you noted, Manitoba Agriculture did not object to Springfield, the arm of Springfield's proposed change in land use designation from agricultural preserve to employment area under bylaw 2411. We recognize that this proposal involves an undersized fragmented parcel adjacent to a designated employment area and the City of Winnipeg. However. However, there are always agricultural concerns when prime agricultural land is proposed for non farm development. Since agricultural lands are valuable and limited resource, we simply ask council to consider whether this change is warranted at this time and if they deem that it is. Sorry. If they deem that it is, our department will not oppose to their decision. So that was a portion of the email that was received from Department of Aggressive. The public hearing notice and bylaw were sent out and circulated to various government departments and surrounding municipalities. At the time the report was written, we had no letters of objection submitted. We had the following comments from the City of Winnipeg. They had some concerns with land drainage for future developments and that can be incorporated within a development agreement at the time of the subdivision. There was also concerns with traffic by the City of Winnipeg which was a traffic impact study that they wanted that can also be incorporated in a future subdivision as a condition. The RM of East St. Paul had no comments. RM of Tache, no concerns. Northeast Red Watershed District, no concerns. SS landfalls outside their district. As mentioned, Manitoba Agriculture reflected on the prime agricultural loss of land. But still they did state that they were not going to object. Manitoba Infrastructure stated that they did not object to this amendment. The following departments had either had no concerns or comments on this amendment being the Lands and Planning Branch, Mines Branch, Bell Mts. Manitoba Hydro mti, Hydrologic Forecasting and Water Management Historic Resource Branch, Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Branch and the CP Rail Municipal Relations. Their comments stated in accordance with section 41 of the Planning Act. The sorry development plan bylaw 2411 is generally consistent with the land use policies in the provincial Land. Provincial planning regulation 812011 community planning recommends that council give consideration to any objections received at the public hearing. Tonight is a public hearing. Council can reject the application if they wish. Council can grant approval of it of second reading only. Council cannot grant a third reading. If council grants second reading, it has to go to the Provincial minister before council can grant third reading. Thank you, Mayor Tarian. Thank you, Dan. At this point here, we'll open it up to the public interactions here. We'll start off with the applicant, Mr. Doolin. Or is. Are you Mr. Doolan? Okay, you're gonna speak on his Behalf. Okay. Then you'll have to go up there to state your name, sir, and your address, and you'll have 10 minutes, sir. So it'll start when we get back into this technological problems. Okay. Do you want me to restate my name? Yes. Okay, so Nathan Mailing from Waterside Development. Business address is 236 Osborne, Winnipeg. So just a brief information here. Nothing's really changed with this application from our previous application, when we made our first application, when we developed this land. At the time council had approved the. The land being changed to this use. We actually initially wanted to incorporate this land as part of that, but at that time, MI had some comments regarding an overchange with Plessies and that roadway. So we basically took that parcel of land out of it for that time just to give them more time for their design and to see what they were going to do with that. So since that's happened now, they don't have any comments reviewed, and so we don't see any reason for any objection at this time. So. Okay, thank you very much, sir. Thank you. Then we'll open it up to the public first. We'll start off for inquiries. We'll start online. We got a new computer system here, so I'm still trying to learn. I don't see any hands, if anybody. I don't see her there. Mrs. Nyland. Thank you. I'm confused about the process you're following tonight. I read in the. Your minutes, your approved minutes of January 23, that a public hearing had been held and that the chair had closed the evidentiary portion of the meeting. You want to take that call or Dan? I guess. No, I think it's a Colleen question. It's in the minutes. It's. I'll decide who's going to answer that, dan or Colleen. Ms. Nyland, you're mentioning the minutes of January 23rd, I believe that's correct. Okay, let me get there. Page seven. I will just address. I found the minutes here. Development Plan Amendment Bylaw 2411. At the request of the applicant, this matter was deferred to a future planning meeting. Meeting. Interesting. I printed off the minutes today, and it says that in attendance, Bob Doolin on behalf of Waterside Development for information. None. In opposition, none. In support, None. The development officer read his report, and the chair closed the evidentiary portion of the meeting. Letters of support, none. Letters of objection, none. Colleen. Colleen. At the request of the applicant, this matter was deferred to a future planning meeting. That came after the evidentiary portion was closed and the Mayor was not present at this hearing. This hearing tonight was re advertised as it was second reading, completely redone. So the second reading that was done in January. Yes, it was closed and it's been re advertised for second reading again tonight. No. You held a public hearing according to your minutes, which is a record, and the deputy mayor closed the evidentiary portion. It's clear. So you either your minutes are in error or you, you can't Right now, all you can counsel can do is consider the evidence that was presented on January 23 and make its decision on the hearing. And the mayor can't vote because he wasn't present or. I don't know. This is a. I don't know. This is confusing to me because you can't have in the minutes one thing and then proceed with with another hearing. It's procedurally incorrect. So the minutes are what happened at the January meeting. So nothing was opened up to the public for comments. So the public hearing did not take place in the respect that we heard from any of the public. Only the development officer read his report out and then the applicant asked to defer. Did the chair not close the evidentiary portion of the meeting that's in your minutes? Yes, in January. And then this new hearing tonight was re advertised like a new public hearing. So people still have the opportunity to speak tonight. So the public hearing is reopened. Public evidentiary hearing. You've never allowed this before. Once it's been closed, that's the end of it. You can't change the rules, Colleen. It's. I mean, my suggestion to you right now is to go back to the audio and check if the minutes are correct. But if the minutes are correct, this hearing is substantially over and you council has to vote. The four members of council that were present have to vote on what was heard on the 23rd of January. Because we've advertised the hearing as a new hearing tonight. My recommendation is that council can go ahead with this tonight and we'll be hearing from any of the public that has anything to add at the hearing. Well, there'll be a challenge, Colleen. You can't have two hearings on the same issue without a vote. At the last meeting, there was no public engagement whatsoever. It doesn't. We started the public hearing, the applicant came in and postponed the public hearing and then we moved on to the next item. And then so we re advertised. Well, that could be, but that's not what your minutes are reflecting. Your, your minutes are reflecting that the chair closed the evidentiary portion of the meeting. Now, I'm not saying your minutes might be wrong. I can't remember the meeting. I don't know even if I was in attendance. But I'm just procedurally, if the evidentiary portion has been closed, that's it. That's the hearing that's done. To my knowledge, when I was at that meeting, I don't recall the evidentiary portion of the meeting being closed. They just agreed to. But I'm trying to find the minutes here. So my written notes in my book do not have that the chair close the evidentiary portion. It says the development officer read the report and then council voted to defer the application at the request of the applicant. So we did not close the public hearing. So we can amend those minutes in the future and confirm that audio. But. No, you can't proceed with this until you review the audio and you go through the process to amend your minutes. Like this is a legal process. You can't. Like the minutes are the written record. We've had a lot of discussion lately that this is what it is and you are reporting verbatim what happens. And so if that happened, and I'm sorry for the applicant here, but this is a legal procedure under the Planning act and your minutes are clear now, I'm not saying they're not wrong, but to remedy that, then, now you have to stop this hearing, review your audio, then go through a process to amend your minutes and then resume the hearing. If that's the case, you can't just say that you can go ahead tonight. That would be unfair because that any decision tonight would be subject to challenge. I would just your opinion. Minutes are not a legal document and they're not verbatim. So if council wants to defer for five minutes, we can check the recording. But. They'Re adopted minutes. Go ahead, Mark. Oh, thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I know this is very awkward, but we have to be legitimate. Otherwise we set ourselves up for a challenge. I don't know what the minutes say. I haven't got them in front of me as well. But if we want to recess and do it procedurally properly, your notes don't mean anything. It's really the minutes. Those are the record. And I know we have dispute about them, but in all contexts and all training that I've had throughout various institutions, they are legal instruments. So we can't just override those. As much as we want to satisfy the applicant and or our procedure just to make it smooth and nice and everybody be happy, we have to be consistent. Otherwise we may as well override everything. We always do. Because the minutes mean nothing is what you're saying. And I take great dispute to that. So, Mr. Mayor, it's up to you if you wish to take a bit of a recess or for the CEO to check the minutes. But we have to work within the minutes that we have. And honestly, I don't know if it was what Ms. Nyland saying or not, but I think it's important for us to. To reflect on those. Otherwise, let's not do minutes because they mean nothing. Okay. Will we have time? Five minutes. About 15 minutes there. That'd be enough time. Or do you want to just go to something else? You can carry on and I can just head out of the chambers and listen to the recording and confirm, but as far as I'm concerned, we've re advertised properly under the act for a new hearing tonight. Okay, just. Just so that we're clear and transparent there. What we'll do is we'll go continue on to the. To the agenda there and we'll come back to this there. Sir. Then if we can go to item 5.2 and that's a variance 2505 under 2040. Transport road signage under McGregor. Can I get a mover in a second for that, please? Mark and Melinda. I'm just opening up the tonight's agenda. So item 5.2. We have a zoning variance 2505. A proposal is to permit a business facial sign to be erected on the rear wall being the east of the building that is not facing a public street as per section 3331 within the MG1 Industrial General Zoning District. This is located at 240 Transport Road within the Southwest Quarter of 1511 4. Mr. McGregor of Platinum Auto Sales is requesting council's approval to erect a fascia signal on the east. On the east rear wall of the industrial building. Under Table 3331 of the zoning bylaw, facial signs are not are only permitted on the wall facing a public street. Mr. McGregor wants to place the second LED sign on the rear side of the industrial building to increase visibility for his business within the traffic along the perimeter highway. A site inspection was conducted. I did not have any concerns with the additional signage at the rear of the existing indust Building. If council were to consider this variation, I would offer the following condition that the applicant obtain the required municipal permits. Thank you. Thank you very much. Would Mr. McGregor be in the audience or online? I don't see any person under that name. Mr. McGregor is. Hello there. Good evening. Oh, sir, did you hear what Mr. Doucet, uh, read out? I did, I did, sorry. I just had it on mute just in case a couple of the kids started running wild. All right, is there anything you wanted to add to that? Are you satisfied with what was read? Yes. Yeah. Okay. If you just want to remain there, sir, we're going to open it up to the public at this time here. First will be inquiries in the audience and are online. Yeah, I see none. Everybody with their hats on, can you please remove them in the chambers there? Thank you very much. Then we'll go to those in favor online and in the audience. And I see none. And then we'll go to those wish to oppose. Sorry, I had it written down here. Those opposed? I see none. Any questions from council before we close? Okay, at this point here, I'm satisfied that all the requirements under the hearing are satisfied. And at this point here, I'm prepared to close the public hearing and no further questions will be allowed. Any questions from council before we go to the vote? I see none. Can you read that, would you? Sure. I will read the resolution out. Whereas a public hearing has been conducted under the planning act to consider an application filed by Mr. Matt McGregor, Platinum Auto Sales on behalf of Jonathan Charal, owner of the property legally described as Lot 17, Block 1, Plan 6 6, or pardon me, Plan 65572 within the Southwest Quarter of 15114 located at 240 Transport Road for variation of the Springfield zoning bylaw to permit a business facial sign to be erected on the rear wall east of the building that is not a fascia not facing a public street AS per Table 3331 within the MG1 Industrial General Zoning district and whereas council has satisfied the requirements of Part 6, variances have been met. Be it resolved that variation order 2505 be granted subject to the following condition and that condition is that the applicant obtain the required municipal permits. Thank you. With the variance being read, Council, can I get a show of hands of those in support first? That is unanimous. And then it is subsequently carried. We'll go to 5.3. That's variance 2502 at 32 Oak Meadow Drive under RMB Properties. Can I get a mover in a second for that, please? Patrick and Glenn. I know you're doing double duty there, Dan, so take your time. No problem. The next zoning variants, we have variants 25 06. The proposal is to permit a reduced east corner side yard of 11.0 plus or minus feet instead of the required 15ft for the construction of a duplex unit as per section 584 number 6 within the RT residential 2 family zoning district. This is located at 32 Oak Meadow Drive within Oak Bank. RNB Properties is seeking council's approval for a reduced east corner side yard setback. The builder, R and B Properties Ltd. Are planning to construct a duplex unit on Lots 21 and 22. The variance will only impact the easterly dwelling on Lot 22. The builder is seeking a variance to create uniformity between the two buildings. If the variance is not granted, the easterly dwelling will be substantially smaller than the westerly building and will not be aesthetically appealing within the development. A site inspection was conducted and I did not have any concerns with the reduced corner side yard. The reduced corner side yard will not have any impacts on traffic sight lines as the dwelling has a front yard setback and is recessed back 31ft from the front street. If council were to consider this variation, I would offer the following condition. One, that the applicant obtain the required municipal permits. Thank you, Maritarian. Thank you very much, Dan. Would the representative of the applicant from R and B Properties be online or in the audience? That's you, sir. Is there anything you want to add more than what Dan had mentioned there? Okay, thank you very much. Then we'll open it up to the to the public inquiry or public hearing portion for inquiries online and in the audience. I see none. Then we'll open it up to both those in favor and those opposed. So either or online or in the audience and I see none. Is there any questions from council at all before I close the hearing portion? And I see none. Then at this point here, I'm satisfied that the public hearing portion has been satisfied and at this point no further questions will be allowed there unless there's any other questions from council and I see none. We can get the variants of red, then we can vote. Whereas a public hearing has been conducted under the Planning act to consider an application filed by R and B Properties on behalf of 10080001 Manitoba Limited, owners of the property legally described as Lot 22, Block 2, Plan 70771 within the northwest quarter of 2115, located at 32 Oak Meadow Dr. For a variation of the Springfield Zoning Bylaw 0801 to permit a reduced east corner side yard setback of 11.0 plus or minus feet instead of the required 15.0ft for the construction of a duplex unit as per section 5846 within the RT Residential 2 Family Zoning District. And whereas council is satisfied that the requirements of Part 6 variances have been met be it result that variation order 25.06be granted subject to the following condition that the applicant obtain the required municipal permits. Thank you. Thank you. With variance 25. 06 being read. Can I get a show of hands from council? Those in support? That is unanimous and it is carried. I see our co's come in. But I'd like to get 5.4 out of the way if that's possible. From council. Everybody in agreement for doing that? Then we'll go to 5.4. That's variance 25. 07. Excuse me. Under Leland there. Can I get a mover and a second or for that too, please. Mark and Melinda. Sorry, I just wanted to make sure we're on the. On the right application variance 25. 07. The proposal is to permit a business facial sign to be erected on the north and south side walls of the building that is not facing a public street within as per table 3313 and a business fascia sign having a maximum letter height of 1.09 meters being 3.58ft instead of the required 0.6 meters being 1.97ft as per section 3333 within the MG1 Industrial General Zoning District. This is located at 245 Transport Road in the Southwest Quarter of 1511 4. Mr. Leland on behalf of DAMAC Ventures is requesting council's approval to allow for the signage to have an increased letter height on the on their business fascia signs and the erection of fascia signs on the south and north walls of the existing industrial building. As stated within section 3333. Facial signs shall not have any letters over 0.6 meters being 1.97, 1.97ft in height and which exceed 80% of the building width. Under table 3331 of the zoning bylaws, fascia signs are only permitted on the front wall of a facing a public street. They are proposing a facial sign on the north and south side of the buildings. The letters height will be a maximum of 3.58 based on the site inspection. I have no concerns with the increased letters on the facial sign or the placement of the signs on the north or south sides of the existing building. If council were to consider this variation, I would offer the following Condition number one, that the applicant obtain the required municipal permits. Thank you, Mayor Taryon. Thank you very much. Rod Leland. Would he be in the audience or online? Yes. Good evening. Hey, Rod. You've heard what Dan had to say. Was there anything more you want to add or are you satisfied with what he had to say? If you have a few minutes, I'd love to speak briefly about our business. So, your worship, just state your name Rod, for everybody in the chambers here as well. Certainly. Thank you, your worship. I'm your worship and members of council, I'm Rod Leland. I. I'm the marketing manager for the Commercial group of companies which includes DAMAC Ventures. Thanks for the opportunity to appear and to speak. And also thank you to Mr. Doucet and his team for their work. So Commercial is the largest work truck dealer and manufacturer in the country. Importantly, we're proudly 100% Canadian owned and operated. We're a private company and we supply fire trucks, tow trucks, snowplows, utility trucks, refuse vehicles, crane trucks, road to rail vehicles and more to municipalities, airports and businesses across the country. We very proudly count the city of Winnipeg, Norway House, Cree Nation, Stonewall, East St. Paul and of course the RM Springfield amongst our customers. And we actually recently delivered the RM Springfield's newest wildland firefighting vehicle, Squad 2, which is now hauled at Fire Station 2. Our other newer branches across the country are bold, modern, industrial styled service and production shops. And we would although all the details in our application, we'd appreciate the approval of our variance application so that we can have our new flagship Oak bank facility bear the same branding as them. And if your worship, if you'd permit our branch managers in the gallery there in person, and if it's possible you'd like to speak a little bit about our branch there and his team. Thank you. Sure. We got a few minutes. Sir, did you want to add more to that? I'm Chris Kaminski. I'm the branch manager for Commercial Truck equipment who is the resident of the building owned by DAMAC Ventures. So we're undergoing a large expansion which the permitting process has already gone through and the building is well on sway. We're expanding our staff to provide well paying jobs to the RM and the surrounding areas. And part of this variant is to allow us to advertise where we are and who we are, as well as to allow us to have the same continuity of our branches across Canada. We're in multiple locations across Canada, right from B.C. to Ontario. Okay, thank you very much. Then we'll open it up to the public hearing portion. We'll open it up for those with inquiries online or in the audience. I see nothing. Then I'll open it up to both those in favor and those opposed so and. Or online first. I see nothing. Or in the audience, any questions from council at all? I see nothing with regards to council's questions. Then at this portion here, I'm satisfied that the hearing portion has been met. And then for legal purposes, no further questions will be allowed and the matter is closed then unless there's any questions from council. And I see none. If I can read the variance, please, and then we can vote. Whereas a public hearing has been conducted under the Planning act to consider an application filed by Rod Leland on behalf of Damac Ventures Limited, owner of the property located at 245 Transport Road, for a variation of the Springfield zoning bylaw number 0801. And whereas council is satisfied that the requirements of Part 6 variances has been met, be it resolved that variation order number 2507 be granted subject to the one condition. Thank you. With that being read under 2507. Can I get a show of hands, those in support? That is unanimous and it is carried. Then we'll continue back to 5.1. We've already got a mover in a second with regards to that. We are awaiting our CEO to do the review there. And if I can hear from the rc. Oh, so I did listen to the recording. So the development officer provided his report, and then the applicant asked to defer and counsel agreed to defer. And the evidentiary portion of the hearing was not closed. So the minutes are inaccurate. And then it was noted that we would re advertise the hearing because new information would be available. We weren't sure what meeting we'd be able to reschedule it to. Okay, but no, no information was heard. Anything as well? No information was heard. Okay. Mrs. Nyland, are you still there? Mrs. Nyland? She's void or she's mute. I don't even have her on the screen here. Yes, I'm still here. Did you hear what our CEO said? Sure. So that's what I wondered. Because your minutes are now inaccurate. So you're going to have to amend your minutes. Yes, we will amend the minutes, but thank you very much for picking that up. Any other questions, ma'? Am? I guess my only other concern is the order that you're going to proceed. But you're going to go ahead, it seems. Obviously so. No. Okay. Thank you. Any other inquiries in the audience or online or. I see none. Then I'll open it up for those in favor. In the audience, I see none. Then online, I see none as well. Then I'll open it up for those opposed. And I see none in the audience or none online. Then I'll open it up to any Questions from accounts. Mr. Mayor. Oh, you're opposed. Okay, if you just go up to the podium there and state your name, please. Hey, good evening. My name is Daniel Page. I'm here as a resident from Sunnyside. So I'm speaking in opposition to this rezoning application. So one thing I wanted to bring forward, just because it's a matter of principle, it's my concern naturally whenever we lose as an RM agriculture preserve land. And I look carefully at the documents put forward both in the planning documents, but also in addition, what I've read and what I've heard today. In addition, I looked over the communication that was went over and summarized briefly. I wanted to touch on two points just. Just to reiterate them because I didn't hear anything about them. And that's kind of a concern of mine because it was communicated in agriculture's communication that it was unclear if this was actually necessary by the applicant to have the rezoning done. There should be some sort of threshold. That's at least my view about this is that there should be a threshold. It shouldn't just be a convenience to rezone agriculture preserve land. It should be that there should be a necessity to do so. And I haven't heard anything that. That necessitates that rezoning. And so that's actually in the communication that's on from January 9, 2024. It's also worth noting that I'm concerned that if council were to proceed with this, it might be deemed premature. Again, like I said, I haven't heard anything that say that this is necessary to do. And I think it's important that we maintain agriculture preserve area in the arm of Springfield. It's a part of the heritage of this, this community. In addition, it is also rather important resource in our community. That's all I have to say. Thank you. Thank you very much. Any questions of Mr. Page? I see none. Thank you, sir. Any others for in opposition? I see none. Oh, mark. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. A resident asked me to read this into the record. I know the CEO received a copy of this document and they. They couldn't be here tonight. So I'm just doing what they're asking me to do. So it's. It's not necessarily my opinion, but it's there. So if I can read it. Go ahead. Okay, it starts. Good evening. My name is Edwin Giesbrecht. I'm a resident and taxpayer of Springfield. Due to an event I'M unable to participate in person this evening. I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to one of our elected officials, Councilor Miller, for kindly agreeing to read my statement on behalf in regards to Agenda 5.1 tonight to the Honorable Council and Mayor, I wish to express concerns about tonight's planning meeting agenda, specifically item 5.1 which involves the proposed subdivision of agricultural preserve zoning for employment slash industrial use. This proposed change raises significant concerns about the appropriate use of land designated for agriculture purposes and undermines the principles of responsible land stewardship. The stark contrast in land use is particularly troubling when considering the long term sustainability of our agricultural resources. While I do not intend to challenge the applicant directly, it is essential to emphasize the importance of maintaining the integrity of agriculture lands which are non renewable resources critical to future generations. Shifting focus towards industrial uses in areas traditionally protected as agriculture preserved lands poses a serious threat to these valuable resources. Additionally, I must address the concerning lack of interaction within the Chamber and the decline in public engagement. Had there been an opportunity during the banished question period to address procedural matters within this very application, it is likely that some outstanding issues related to the potential integrity of the hearing could have been addressed. Open dialogue and the ability for the public to address questions have been increasingly restricted in a manner that can only be described as authoritarian. This suppression of community input has significantly reduced public participation, effectively limiting the community's ability to ask important questions of the Council, which undermines both transparency and accountability. Moreover, the small venue and limited time for public input in this hearing present further challenges. While I am confident that our COO and her administration would not wish to mislead any counselor with unfounded or misguided advice and ensure procedural standards are being implemented to the highest of standards. It is essential that all procedural considerations be accurately presented to the Council before any decisions are made. This is essentially important given that an administrative report states On November 21, 2025, Council granted First Reading referencing Agenda Item 5.1. This may be typographical error which now I guess we know, but it has not been adequately scrutinized, raising concerns about the integrity of other aspects of the process. This is no trivial matter. People's lives and futures deserve respect and response of governments governance. Rather, on a broader note, the Administration's previous issue or use of the term equivalency requires attention. The suggestion that agricultural land can be fairly reclassified to employment industrial zoning is a contradiction in terms. Such a reclassification not only misapplies the concept of equivalency, but also misrepresents the core planning principles. The RM's willingness to flip zoning in this matter runs counter to previous declarations regarding responsible land use, raising serious concerns about the consistency and integrity of decision making. I present these concerns to the honorable council in the hope that your decisions will be made with truthfulness and honor, guided by the principles of transparency, accountability and responsible governance, with understanding that I am adverse to the disingenuous flipping of equivalency clearly set out in this hearing. Untoward. Second reading. Thank you. Thank you. I'll put that down. As opposed then is. Did I miss anybody in the audience or online I see. Ms. Nyla. Have I been unmuted? Can you hear me okay? I don't know. Sometimes it pops up that I've been unmuted. I don't know. I guess my concern and opposition to this is the area is being changed from an agricultural use and that will impact a lot of other things on surrounding properties. And I'm particularly concerned about the land drainage in the area. No. Pardon me. First would be the traffic that it'll impact in the area, then the land drainage and possible impacts on groundwater. And I wonder if it would. Be. Something that council would consider before they make their decision is to have some studies done on traffic and traffic impact on that area and any drainage and wastewater impacts before you make your decision. So I'm opposed without those studies. Thank you very much. Any questions from council at all? I see none. I'm satisfied that all the portions with regards to the public has been heard and our agenda package is quite detailed. Then at this point here I'm prepared to close the public hearing portion and no further comments or questions will be allowed at this time. Time. Is there any questions from council before we read the the resolution? Mark. Thank you, Mayor. I of course, as my environmental side has concern with erosion of preserved land, agriculture, valuable agricultural land, not only for that purpose because we've seen the whittling down of of agricultural land and preserve land, quite frankly throughout our municipality and other municipalities across the province, across Canada, across the world and so forth. So how far do we go until it's too late to go back? Actually it is too late to go back, but so there's impacts as has been suggested from other delegations who are opposed. I'm concerned about the flora and the fauna, but more importantly about how we continue to erode the agriculture preserve land within our own community. We have to look in a sincere way in our local environment, not just broadly, but I think there's importance for us to encourage development where development is warranted and, and necessary perhaps. But in this particular case I feel that it's designated as agriculture preserved for a purpose. And I. That's. Those are my comments. Thank you, Councilor Miller. Any other comments from council before we send it off to vote? Since I'm the chair, I have a last comments here. I find this is a well detailed plan. The other plan, the larger section, I will call it phase one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think it's significant here. That's a larger portion. This is a small 17.4 acre lot area to be used right now. I think there's, you know, tons and tons of sand that's on that land right now. So it's. It's contiguous. That's the main word here. It's contiguous to the, to the development there. It's in an ideal spot. It'll serve our community very well. The. The concern with regards to the drainage. Well, that drainage will be. That's part of the agreement that. That has to be satisfied. Transportation has been involved in this and I was going to say a lot with regards to the Ag Preserve. I'm always concerned about Ag Preserve and I think everybody on council is too. But that said, this property here is rather small and Michelle, Herb, you know, she said exactly what I was going to say. But obviously she's got the credentials and she knows the concerns that we all have and I'm all for that. This development going ahead. So if we can read the variance there, the development Plan Amendment Bylaw 2410 for Ag Preserve, Second Reading 5.1 then we can vote on it be it. Resolved that second reading be given to bylaw number 2411 being a bylaw of the arm of Springfield to redesignate all Those lands under CT 304-15-3331 described as Lot 134 Plan 433 in RCMP within the Southwest Quarter 29104 from Agricultural Preserve area to employment. Thank you. With that being read, can I get show of hands first for those in support? That'll be Councillor Warren, Deputy Mayor Fuel and Mayor Tarrian. Those opposed, councillors Kaczynski and Miller. And it is so passed. Then this point here we're going. Where did we leave off here at 5.4, 5.5. Can I get a show of hands or mover and a seconder for variance 25 05, 5.5 under the agenda for Reichert Mover in a seconder, please. Melinda and Andy. We have zoning variance 25 08. The proposal is to permit a front yard setback of 95ft instead of the required 125ft for the construction of an addition to a dwelling unit as per section 8343 within the AR Agricultural Restricted Zoning District. This is located at 67110 PR 212 within the north half of section 1212. 5. The applicant is requesting council's approval to allow for the reduced front yard setback for the Construction of a 900 or sorry. 392 square foot addition to the dwelling unit. The dwelling was constructed in 1961 and has a front yard setback of 95ft which was prior to the current zoning bylaw requirement of the 125 foot front yard setback. The dwelling is currently lawfully non conforming and non conforming building may continue to be in use but the building shall not be enlarged or added to or rebuilt structurally altered as it. Until it is made to conform with the. With the. Let me repeat that. Altered until it is made into a conforming building via this zoning variance. A site inspection was conducted and I did not have any concerns with the new new addition which will maintain the 95 foot front yard setback. The addition will be to the south of the existing dwelling. If council were to consider this variation, I would offer the following two conditions. Number one, that this, that this applicant obtained the required municipal building permits and number two that the applicant obtained the required provincial MI Manitoba infrastructure permit as the dwelling falls within the MI control zone. Thank you Mayor Terran. Thank you very much. Would the applicant be in the audience? Mr. Reichert, with that red, sir, is there anything you want to add at all? Satisfied with that? Thank you. Then we'll open it up to the public there first for inquiries online and in the audience. See none. Then we'll open it up for those in favor and. Or those opposed. So both categories online and in the audience. Sir. Just state your name as sir. And they got 10 minutes. Chris Kaminsky. My address is 67097 PR212 so I am the Reichardt's neighbor. No problem with the variance moving forward as my permission. Thank you very much, sir. Then I don't see anybody else in the audience. Any questions from council before we close this? I see none at this time here. I'm satisfied the public hearing portion has been met and at this point here I'm closing the public hearing. No further questions will be allowed. Then if there's no questions and I see none, we'll read the variance and we can vote. Whereas a public hearing has been conducted under the Planning act to consider an application filed by David Reichardt and Lisa Smith, owner of the Property located at 67110 PR212 for a variation of the Springfield Zoning Bylaw Number 0801. Whereas Council is satisfied that the requirements of Part 6 variances has been met. Be it resolved that variation order number 2508 be granted subject to the two conditions. Thank you. If I can get a show of hands of those in Support for variance 2508, that is unanimous and it is carried. Well, it's nice to have the neighbors here and two items at the same time. You guys work this out or what? Okay, then we'll move on to conditional use25.06 under Heinrich and Newman. Can I get a mover in a seconder for 5.6, please? Melinda and Mark, we have conditional use 25 06. The proposal is to permit an automotive and equipment repair shop on the land as per section 6935 within the MG Industrial General Zoning District.

They have seven parking spaces allowed within the rent for the rental of unit number eight. Two spots will be for employee parking and five spots will be for customer parking. At the time of the site inspection, it was observed that Unit 8 was vacant and I have no concerns with the proposed business subject to the original building permit being closed. If council were to consider this conditional use application, I would offer the following five conditions. Number one, that the building permit shall be closed prior to receiving an occupancy permit. Number two, that our municipal building inspector and fire chief shall conduct a building and fire inspection for the existing industrial building to ensure that all life, safety, building and fire code requirements are met and that any other code upgrades and or infractions are corrected prior to the operation of the business and the issuance of any Correspondence to MPI number three, that a development permit be obtained for any signage related to the business. Number three, this order shall expire and become null and void on the date the business ceases to be in operation. And number five, this.

Gentlemen, are you satisfied with what Mr. Giuset had said? Okay. Nothing else you want to add? Okay, thank you very much. Then at this portion here, at this time here, I should say that I'm going to open it up to the public first for inquiries online and in the audience, and I see none. Then I open it up for those in favor and or those opposed. So both categories online and in the audience, and I see none. Any questions from council? Again, I see none.

Nice to see young guys trying to. To get into the business there. It's very much appreciating our RM. Thanks, guys. Then we'll go to 5.7. That's conditional use 2508 under home industry. UNRA. Can I get a mover secondary for that too, please? Mark and Melinda, we have conditional use 25 08. The proposal is to permit a home industry being a sewage hauler operator. Sorry, sewage hauler, owner operator, on the land as per section 84314 within the Ag1 Agricultural General Zoning District.

He would like to have access to to the Springfield Lagoon for the Springfield clients and hopes to use the Winnipeg wastewater treatment plant being North Main street location for all other tanks. He has been in contact with other municipalities to go over their rules and regulations for pumping within their areas. The proposed hours of operation would be Monday to Friday, 8am to 6 6pm but may vary during depending on emergency pump outs. Mr. Unrud would like to start the business by May 30th of this year. He had also indicated one of his direct Mr. Unra has one direct neighbor directly to the east. The property is not visible from Oakwood Road due to heavy vegetation as per the photos provided to council. We had also received one letter of support late this evening which has been provided to council and that was from Mr. And Mrs. Longstreet which Council has before them.

Is there anything more that you would like to add from what Dan had mentioned here? You're happy with that? Okay then at this point here we're going to open it up to the the public portion for those inquiries online and in the audience and I see none. Then once again I'll open it up for those in favor and or those opposed. So both categories online and in the audience and I see none. Any questions from Council at all and I see none there as well. I'm happy with the councillor Miller had raised. Oh, go ahead, Mark. Oh, thank you, Mr. Mayor. First off, I want to welcome this potential business to our community. I think it's long overdue. I had an instance where on. New. Year's Eve I had a freeze up and I had to search readily for septic cleanout operators and I, I, I was actually appalled at the amount that they were charging for an emergency pump out. It was something like $600 but if it wasn't for that our basement would have flooded with sewage backing up. But having said that, I'm glad that there's going to be somebody frankly more local that perhaps we can depend on. I canvass the area extensively and unfortunately there wasn't that. So I'm very optimistic and encourage you to strive forth and hopefully you'll get to the two traps two trucks sooner than you even want to. Any other questions or comments from council? I see none. Then at this time here I'm satisfied the public hearing portion has been met and no further question will be allowed for legal reasons and prepared to close the public hearing. So if I can get the reading. And we can vote as a public hearing has been conducted under the Planning act to consider an application filed by Camera Unra and Rachel Harder, owners of the property located at 4100 Oakwood Road for a conditional use under the Springfield zoning bylaw number 0801. Whereas council is satisfied that the requirements of Part 7 conditional uses has been met be it resolved that conditional use order number 2508 be granted subject to the eight conditions. Thank you.

They have been a successful business for the past three years and due to their success they want to expand to include vehicle sales now. Site plan was provided by the applicant showing the allocated parking areas. A site inspection was conducted and I have no concerns with this proposed business.

Then I'll open it up to the to the public online and then the audience for inquiries nobody's seen to identify themselves and open it up for both those in favor and those opposed so and or those in favor of those opposed online and in the audience. Any questions from council then I'm prepared at this point to hear Satisfied the public hearing portion has been met, prepared to close the hearing and no further questions are allowed.

Whereas a public hearing has been conducted under the Planning act to consider an application filed by Charles Liu on behalf of Jtech Holding Ltd.

The proposal is to permit an automotive and recreational vehicle sales on the land as per section 6935 within the MG Industrial General Zoning District. This is within unit 4 of 2071 Plessy Road in the Southwest Quarter of 1711 4. For clarity, I noticed here that the owner is actually my niece's husband. So I'm more than ready to excuse myself for this vote. I'm not sure how that applies, but I don't want to be seen in a conflict. But I'm more than happy to excuse myself. I personally don't think that would be an issue, but I'll. Yeah, if you feel there's financial benefit to you approving this, then that would be something you could take. Okay. Just for the record, Councilor Miller has left the room just for being a conflict here and perceived or otherwise. I will continue with my report. Mr. Buffy is requesting council's approval to permit an automotive and recreational vehicle sales business within Unit 4 at 2071 Plessy Road. As indicated within their letter of intent. They plan to operate an automotive brokerage brokerage specializing in assisting. Assisting clients in purchasing and financing vehicles from various dealerships. They have stated that the site will include office space and a sales and display area for their extra vehicles. Their proposed business hours of operation will be Monday to Saturday, 9am to 6pm they anticipate to employ four to five people. The applicant foresees to have five to seven vehicles displayed on site. There is space for seven vehicles in the front of their office and four vehicles inside the building. There are five spaces at the rear for employee parking as well for employee vehicles. At the time of the site inspection, it was observed that unit four was vacant. And I have no concerns with this proposed proposed business operation. If council were to consider this conditional use, I would offer the following conditions. Number one, a development permit be obtained for the signage related to the business. Number two, this order shall expire and become null and void on the date the business ceases to be in operation. And number three, this order shall not be transferable to any other owner and or lessee. Council will note I did not place any conditions regarding the site inspection by our fire chief and building inspector. This is a brand new construction building that just got signed off and closed. Thank you, Mayor tarrant. Thank you, Mr. Doucet. There would Mr. Charles Liu be in the audience or online? I don't see. Oh, Buffy. Sorry. Apologize for that. Would he be in line and I don't see him been present. Then if I can get for the public portion for inquiries on online and in the audience. I see none. Then we'll open it up for those in favor and or those opposed together. And there's nothing online? No. Or online or in the audience. Then at this unless there's any questions from council and I see none are prepared to close a public hearing portion as there's no further question will be permitted and the it is closed. And if we can read the conditional. Use Whereas a public hearing has been conducted under the Planning act to consider an application filed by Ryan Buffy on behalf of Kyle Litwin, owner of the property located at Unit 42071 plus Eaves Road for conditional use under the Springfield zoning bylaw number 0801. Whereas council is satisfied that the requirements of Part 7 conditional uses has been met be it resolved that conditional use order number 25 to 10 be granted. Subject to the three conditions with conditional use red. Can I get a show of hands those in support? Councillor Warren Kaczynski Fuel and Tarian. Constable Miller has abstained from from the vote there and it is carried. And then we'll move on to item 6.1, the last on our agenda here. And we'll just wait for Councilor Miller to come back here. Actually, can I get a mover and a second or for this as well? Glenn and Melinda. Thanks. Okay, so we have a mover intersector for 6.1. That's a proposal to subdivide the request for caveat removal under a long number for 25022 open under meanan. Wonder if I can get Dan to speak to this. And then we proceed. I'll give counsel a quick brief. This is not a public hearing. What we have Mr. Minan had. Mr. And Mrs. Minan had provided me with a formal request to go before council for a full discharge of a registered caveat which is caveated to certificate of title number 3301-501-Winnipeg land titles. The development agreement was an agreement between the municipality and the Minans. The municipal and Northern relations were not party to this agreement. The registered caveat was placed on title back on June 3, 2024. The development agreement restricted any residential buildings, excluding agricultural buildings. The development agreement was a condition imposed by municipal and Northern relations as condition number three listed within their conditional approval letter relating to a subdivision application. Below is an Excerpt from the Municipal Northern Relations Council referral letter back on November 22, 2023, which was attached to council. Also, please note that council did not include the development agreement as a condition of the resolution of Council 23. 4, 7, 3. Sorry. 4, 7, 9. Which is part of the report. So what Mr. Minan had done originally with the application, they had severed their parcel of land which they were splitting 30. 30 acres off for specialized agriculture. And then there's the residual parcel of agricultural land. If council were to consider approving the request for the full discharge, I had the following resolution drafted, but it's totally under council's discretion and consideration. Mr. Minan is here in the gallery as well, if the council has any questions. Thank you, Mayor Tarian. Thank you. Daniel. Minan would. Is there anything else you want to add there, Dan? But Mr. Doucet hasn't mentioned. Okay, thank you very much. Any questions from council at all? I see none. Then I'm prepared to have it read, and then we can vote on it. Just to clarify, Ms. Nyland, this is not a public hearing. Go ahead. I'm. I'm not. I guess my point is the. This isn't a public hearing. I. I understand that. It's a. It's a point of order, Mr. Mayor. It. It reads as. It's a proposal to subdivide. It's not a proposal to subdivide. So I guess I was thinking that's what we were doing. There's no further subdivision. What you're doing is now a council action after a subdivision. So the point of order is that you're now removing a caveat that was put on an agreement a short while ago. And I'm just wondering if those that spoke at that time have been consulted about removing that agreement. Agreement, Dan? I don't think we required to do that. This originally was a subdivision that was proposed before council, and the request now is the removal of the caveat. No, this did not get circulated to any of the surrounding landowners, nor was it a requirement. This was an agreement that was placed on by the provincial government within their conditional approval. They are not party to the agreement. Municipal and Northern relations. They forced council to enter into this agreement. Now Mr. Minan is asking for the discharge of this. It's up to council if they wish to discharge it or not. Thank you. Any questions from my council at all? Andy? Yes, Mr. Mind. So what, you're actually asking to remove this caveat for what? The purpose? So somebody come and can build the house on this property? No, not yet. Dan, can you answer that? What Mr. Minan's intent is? Yeah, so I'm thinking about the policies and so on like that. Is that something that you can ask or maybe Dan can answer better. The rationale why he wants to discharge or why the caveat was placed on the property? Well, the caveat that would be something that you can answer. I can answer the caveat why it was placed. Manitoba Agriculture did want. Did not want multiple houses within the area. So they place the development on there. I understand that Mr. Minan is trying to sell the property. Some of the farmers are not even looking at the property. If they can't even put a farmstead dwelling on on that site. You can ask Mr. Minan as he's been dealing with real estate agents directly. Councillor Kaczynski, does that answer your question there or is it something else? Well, how is this land rezoned now? How is it zoned right now? It's owned agricultural. Agricultural preserve. So it preserve agricultural land? Yeah. So only the building that could be allowed there. It's a farm building? Farm building, yeah. Okay, thank you. Any other questions? Then if we can read the caveat. Be resolved that a full discharge be granted for caveat number 564-421-51 from Lot 2, Plan 73464 under CT 3301-501 within part of Northwest Quarter 20115 subject to the following condition. The applicant shall be responsible for the $200 municipal fee, all legal expenses and all property registry charges for the full discharge of said KVs. Yet then if. I'll put it out to the vote from council. Those in the in support? That'll be Councillor Warren Miller, Councilor Fuel and Tarian. Those opposed? Councillor Kaczynski. And it is so passed. Then adjournment. Can I get a mover in a second or two? Adjourn. That's Mark and Glenn. And it is solo adjourned at 7:28pm thank you. Take care there, Dan.

And again, once I, the Chairperson, close a public hearing, no further discussion will be allowed. With that read, we'll move to the public hearing portion. The first will be 5.1. That's a development plan amendment. Bylaw 2411, Agricultural Preserve to employment. Can I get a mover and a seconder for that, please? Glenn and Melinda.
Speaker C: We have bylaw 2411. This is an application to redesignate land from agricultural preserve to employment. Mr. Bill McGarry, President of Waterside Development Corp. Owner of the property, has made an application for the development plan Amendment on Lot 134, Plan 433 within south within the Southwest section of 2910 4. The applicant is seeking to redesignate the property from agricultural preserve area to employment. Mr. McGarry intends to subdivide the approximate 17.4 acres of land to create additional industrial lots, including an internal municipal road. No conceptual plan was provided to our offices of yet. On November 21, Council had granted first reading of Bylaw 2411 under Resolution 24433. The public hearing was scheduled for the January 23, 2025 meeting. At the onset of the public hearing, a representative From Waterside Development, Mr. Ball, Bob Doolin, had stated that he wanted to postpone the public hearing to a later date and he was awaiting additional information from the Department of Agriculture to be submitted to council within the within or with the public hearing now being reconvened, we had to start the notification process over again. The following persons or departments have received the following notification on the following dates. February 10, the Minister being Municipal and Northern Relations. Also on February 10, the applicants received the notice of public hearing. February 10 was submitted to the surrounding municipalities and planning district. On March 11, the public hearing notices were mailed by regular mail to those surrounding 100 meters of the subject property and those who had signed in. Also at the January February 23rd original public hearing. March 11th public hearing notice were posted at the municipal office, the planning office on the municipal and the municipal website. March 11 Public Hearing Notice was also posted on the subject site. March 13th and 20th there was two publications in the Clipper weekly for this public hearing. This evening Mr. Doolin was speaking about an email that he had received from Michelle Erb from Department of Agriculture and I've only given him a small excerpt of that email. Council has the original and it was also Included in my original package. Ms. Erb had stated, as you noted, Manitoba Agriculture did not object to Springfield, the arm of Springfield's proposed change in land use designation from agricultural preserve to employment area under bylaw 2411. We recognize that this proposal involves an undersized fragmented parcel adjacent to a designated employment area and the City of Winnipeg.
Speaker D: However.
Speaker C: However, there are always agricultural concerns when prime agricultural land is proposed for non farm development. Since agricultural lands are valuable and limited resource, we simply ask council to consider whether this change is warranted at this time and if they deem that it is. Sorry. If they deem that it is, our department will not oppose to their decision. So that was a portion of the email that was received from Department of Aggressive. The public hearing notice and bylaw were sent out and circulated to various government departments and surrounding municipalities. At the time the report was written, we had no letters of objection submitted. We had the following comments from the City of Winnipeg. They had some concerns with land drainage for future developments and that can be incorporated within a development agreement at the time of the subdivision. There was also concerns with traffic by the City of Winnipeg which was a traffic impact study that they wanted that can also be incorporated in a future subdivision as a condition. The RM of East St. Paul had no comments. RM of Tache, no concerns. Northeast Red Watershed District, no concerns. SS landfalls outside their district. As mentioned, Manitoba Agriculture reflected on the prime agricultural loss of land. But still they did state that they were not going to object. Manitoba Infrastructure stated that they did not object to this amendment. The following departments had either had no concerns or comments on this amendment being the Lands and Planning Branch, Mines Branch, Bell Mts. Manitoba Hydro mti, Hydrologic Forecasting and Water Management Historic Resource Branch, Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Branch and the CP Rail Municipal Relations. Their comments stated in accordance with section 41 of the Planning Act. The sorry development plan bylaw 2411 is generally consistent with the land use policies in the provincial Land. Provincial planning regulation 812011 community planning recommends that council give consideration to any objections received at the public hearing. Tonight is a public hearing. Council can reject the application if they wish. Council can grant approval of it of second reading only. Council cannot grant a third reading. If council grants second reading, it has to go to the Provincial minister before council can grant third reading. Thank you, Mayor Tarian.
Speaker A: Thank you, Dan. At this point here, we'll open it up to the public interactions here. We'll start off with the applicant, Mr. Doolin. Or is. Are you Mr. Doolan? Okay, you're gonna speak on his Behalf. Okay. Then you'll have to go up there to state your name, sir, and your address, and you'll have 10 minutes, sir. So it'll start when we get back into this technological problems.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker E: Do you want me to restate my name?
Speaker C: Yes.
Speaker E: Okay, so Nathan Mailing from Waterside Development. Business address is 236 Osborne, Winnipeg. So just a brief information here. Nothing's really changed with this application from our previous application, when we made our first application, when we developed this land. At the time council had approved the. The land being changed to this use. We actually initially wanted to incorporate this land as part of that, but at that time, MI had some comments regarding an overchange with Plessies and that roadway. So we basically took that parcel of land out of it for that time just to give them more time for their design and to see what they were going to do with that. So since that's happened now, they don't have any comments reviewed, and so we don't see any reason for any objection at this time.       
Speaker A: So. Okay, thank you very much, sir. Thank you. Then we'll open it up to the public first. We'll start off for inquiries. We'll start online. We got a new computer system here, so I'm still trying to learn. I don't see any hands, if anybody. I don't see her there. Mrs. Nyland.
Speaker F: Thank you. I'm confused about the process you're following tonight. I read in the. Your minutes, your approved minutes of January 23, that a public hearing had been held and that the chair had closed the evidentiary portion of the meeting.
Speaker A: You want to take that call or Dan? I guess.
Speaker F: No, I think it's a Colleen question. It's in the minutes. It's.
Speaker A: I'll decide who's going to answer that, dan or Colleen.
Speaker C: Ms. Nyland, you're mentioning the minutes of January 23rd, I believe that's correct. Okay, let me get there.
Speaker F: Page seven.
Speaker B: I will just address. I found the minutes here. Development Plan Amendment Bylaw 2411. At the request of the applicant, this matter was deferred to a future planning meeting. Meeting.
Speaker F: Interesting. I printed off the minutes today, and it says that in attendance, Bob Doolin on behalf of Waterside Development for information. None. In opposition, none. In support, None. The development officer read his report, and the chair closed the evidentiary portion of the meeting. Letters of support, none. Letters of objection, none.
Speaker G: Colleen.
Speaker C: Colleen.
Speaker F: At the request of the applicant, this matter was deferred to a future planning meeting. That came after the evidentiary portion was closed and the Mayor was not present at this hearing.
Speaker B: This hearing tonight was re advertised as it was second reading, completely redone. So the second reading that was done in January. Yes, it was closed and it's been re advertised for second reading again tonight.
Speaker F: No. You held a public hearing according to your minutes, which is a record, and the deputy mayor closed the evidentiary portion. It's clear. So you either your minutes are in error or you, you can't Right now, all you can counsel can do is consider the evidence that was presented on January 23 and make its decision on the hearing. And the mayor can't vote because he wasn't present or. I don't know. This is a. I don't know. This is confusing to me because you can't have in the minutes one thing and then proceed with with another hearing. It's procedurally incorrect.
Speaker B: So the minutes are what happened at the January meeting. So nothing was opened up to the public for comments. So the public hearing did not take place in the respect that we heard from any of the public. Only the development officer read his report out and then the applicant asked to defer.
Speaker F: Did the chair not close the evidentiary portion of the meeting that's in your minutes?
Speaker B: Yes, in January. And then this new hearing tonight was re advertised like a new public hearing. So people still have the opportunity to speak tonight. So the public hearing is reopened.
Speaker F: Public evidentiary hearing. You've never allowed this before. Once it's been closed, that's the end of it. You can't change the rules, Colleen. It's. I mean, my suggestion to you right now is to go back to the audio and check if the minutes are correct. But if the minutes are correct, this hearing is substantially over and you council has to vote. The four members of council that were present have to vote on what was heard on the 23rd of January.
Speaker B: Because we've advertised the hearing as a new hearing tonight. My recommendation is that council can go ahead with this tonight and we'll be hearing from any of the public that has anything to add at the hearing.
Speaker F: Well, there'll be a challenge, Colleen. You can't have two hearings on the same issue without a vote.
Speaker C: At the last meeting, there was no public engagement whatsoever.
Speaker F: It doesn't.
Speaker C: We started the public hearing, the applicant came in and postponed the public hearing and then we moved on to the next item. And then so we re advertised.
Speaker F: Well, that could be, but that's not what your minutes are reflecting. Your, your minutes are reflecting that the chair closed the evidentiary portion of the meeting. Now, I'm not saying your minutes might be wrong. I can't remember the meeting. I don't know even if I was in attendance. But I'm just procedurally, if the evidentiary portion has been closed, that's it. That's the hearing that's done.
Speaker C: To my knowledge, when I was at that meeting, I don't recall the evidentiary portion of the meeting being closed. They just agreed to. But I'm trying to find the minutes here.
Speaker B: So my written notes in my book do not have that the chair close the evidentiary portion. It says the development officer read the report and then council voted to defer the application at the request of the applicant. So we did not close the public hearing. So we can amend those minutes in the future and confirm that audio. But.
Speaker F: No, you can't proceed with this until you review the audio and you go through the process to amend your minutes. Like this is a legal process. You can't. Like the minutes are the written record. We've had a lot of discussion lately that this is what it is and you are reporting verbatim what happens. And so if that happened, and I'm sorry for the applicant here, but this is a legal procedure under the Planning act and your minutes are clear now, I'm not saying they're not wrong, but to remedy that, then, now you have to stop this hearing, review your audio, then go through a process to amend your minutes and then resume the hearing. If that's the case, you can't just say that you can go ahead tonight. That would be unfair because that any decision tonight would be subject to challenge.
Speaker B: I would just your opinion. Minutes are not a legal document and they're not verbatim. So if council wants to defer for five minutes, we can check the recording. But.
Speaker F: They'Re adopted minutes.
Speaker A: Go ahead, Mark.
Speaker G: Oh, thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I know this is very awkward, but we have to be legitimate. Otherwise we set ourselves up for a challenge. I don't know what the minutes say. I haven't got them in front of me as well. But if we want to recess and do it procedurally properly, your notes don't mean anything. It's really the minutes. Those are the record. And I know we have dispute about them, but in all contexts and all training that I've had throughout various institutions, they are legal instruments. So we can't just override those. As much as we want to satisfy the applicant and or our procedure just to make it smooth and nice and everybody be happy, we have to be consistent. Otherwise we may as well override everything. We always do. Because the minutes mean nothing is what you're saying. And I take great dispute to that. So, Mr. Mayor, it's up to you if you wish to take a bit of a recess or for the CEO to check the minutes. But we have to work within the minutes that we have. And honestly, I don't know if it was what Ms. Nyland saying or not, but I think it's important for us to. To reflect on those. Otherwise, let's not do minutes because they mean nothing.
Speaker A: Okay. Will we have time? Five minutes. About 15 minutes there. That'd be enough time. Or do you want to just go to something else?
Speaker B: You can carry on and I can just head out of the chambers and listen to the recording and confirm, but as far as I'm concerned, we've re advertised properly under the act for a new hearing tonight.
Speaker A: Okay, just. Just so that we're clear and transparent there. What we'll do is we'll go continue on to the. To the agenda there and we'll come back to this there. Sir. Then if we can go to item 5.2 and that's a variance 2505 under 2040. Transport road signage under McGregor. Can I get a mover in a second for that, please? Mark and Melinda.
Speaker C: I'm just opening up the tonight's agenda. So item 5.2. We have a zoning variance 2505. A proposal is to permit a business facial sign to be erected on the rear wall being the east of the building that is not facing a public street as per section 3331 within the MG1 Industrial General Zoning District. This is located at 240 Transport Road within the Southwest Quarter of 1511 4. Mr. McGregor of Platinum Auto Sales is requesting council's approval to erect a fascia signal on the east. On the east rear wall of the industrial building. Under Table 3331 of the zoning bylaw, facial signs are not are only permitted on the wall facing a public street. Mr. McGregor wants to place the second LED sign on the rear side of the industrial building to increase visibility for his business within the traffic along the perimeter highway. A site inspection was conducted. I did not have any concerns with the additional signage at the rear of the existing indust Building. If council were to consider this variation, I would offer the following condition that the applicant obtain the required municipal permits. Thank you.
Speaker A: Thank you very much. Would Mr. McGregor be in the audience or online? I don't see any person under that name.
Speaker C: Mr. McGregor is.
Speaker A: Hello there. Good evening. Oh, sir, did you hear what Mr. Doucet, uh, read out? I did, I did, sorry.
Speaker C: I just had it on mute just in case a couple of the kids started running wild.
Speaker A: All right, is there anything you wanted to add to that? Are you satisfied with what was read? Yes. Yeah. Okay. If you just want to remain there, sir, we're going to open it up to the public at this time here. First will be inquiries in the audience and are online. Yeah, I see none. Everybody with their hats on, can you please remove them in the chambers there? Thank you very much. Then we'll go to those in favor online and in the audience. And I see none. And then we'll go to those wish to oppose. Sorry, I had it written down here. Those opposed? I see none. Any questions from council before we close? Okay, at this point here, I'm satisfied that all the requirements under the hearing are satisfied. And at this point here, I'm prepared to close the public hearing and no further questions will be allowed. Any questions from council before we go to the vote? I see none. Can you read that, would you?
Speaker C: Sure. I will read the resolution out. Whereas a public hearing has been conducted under the planning act to consider an application filed by Mr. Matt McGregor, Platinum Auto Sales on behalf of Jonathan Charal, owner of the property legally described as Lot 17, Block 1, Plan 6 6, or pardon me, Plan 65572 within the Southwest Quarter of 15114 located at 240 Transport Road for variation of the Springfield zoning bylaw to permit a business facial sign to be erected on the rear wall east of the building that is not a fascia not facing a public street AS per Table 3331 within the MG1 Industrial General Zoning district and whereas council has satisfied the requirements of Part 6, variances have been met. Be it resolved that variation order 2505 be granted subject to the following condition and that condition is that the applicant obtain the required municipal permits.
Speaker A: Thank you. With the variance being read, Council, can I get a show of hands of those in support first? That is unanimous. And then it is subsequently carried. We'll go to 5.3. That's variance 2502 at 32 Oak Meadow Drive under RMB Properties. Can I get a mover in a second for that, please? Patrick and Glenn. I know you're doing double duty there, Dan, so take your time.
Speaker C: No problem. The next zoning variants, we have variants 25 06. The proposal is to permit a reduced east corner side yard of 11.0 plus or minus feet instead of the required 15ft for the construction of a duplex unit as per section 584 number 6 within the RT residential 2 family zoning district. This is located at 32 Oak Meadow Drive within Oak Bank. RNB Properties is seeking council's approval for a reduced east corner side yard setback. The builder, R and B Properties Ltd. Are planning to construct a duplex unit on Lots 21 and 22. The variance will only impact the easterly dwelling on Lot 22. The builder is seeking a variance to create uniformity between the two buildings. If the variance is not granted, the easterly dwelling will be substantially smaller than the westerly building and will not be aesthetically appealing within the development. A site inspection was conducted and I did not have any concerns with the reduced corner side yard. The reduced corner side yard will not have any impacts on traffic sight lines as the dwelling has a front yard setback and is recessed back 31ft from the front street. If council were to consider this variation, I would offer the following condition. One, that the applicant obtain the required municipal permits. Thank you, Maritarian.
Speaker A: Thank you very much, Dan. Would the representative of the applicant from R and B Properties be online or in the audience? That's you, sir. Is there anything you want to add more than what Dan had mentioned there? Okay, thank you very much. Then we'll open it up to the to the public inquiry or public hearing portion for inquiries online and in the audience. I see none. Then we'll open it up to both those in favor and those opposed. So either or online or in the audience and I see none. Is there any questions from council at all before I close the hearing portion? And I see none. Then at this point here, I'm satisfied that the public hearing portion has been satisfied and at this point no further questions will be allowed there unless there's any other questions from council and I see none. We can get the variants of red, then we can vote.
Speaker C: Whereas a public hearing has been conducted under the Planning act to consider an application filed by R and B Properties on behalf of 10080001 Manitoba Limited, owners of the property legally described as Lot 22, Block 2, Plan 70771 within the northwest quarter of 2115, located at 32 Oak Meadow Dr. For a variation of the Springfield Zoning Bylaw 0801 to permit a reduced east corner side yard setback of 11.0 plus or minus feet instead of the required 15.0ft for the construction of a duplex unit as per section 5846 within the RT Residential 2 Family Zoning District. And whereas council is satisfied that the requirements of Part 6 variances have been met be it result that variation order 25.06be granted subject to the following condition that the applicant obtain the required municipal permits. Thank you.
Speaker A: Thank you. With variance 25. 06 being read. Can I get a show of hands from council? Those in support? That is unanimous and it is carried. I see our co's come in. But I'd like to get 5.4 out of the way if that's possible. From council. Everybody in agreement for doing that? Then we'll go to 5.4. That's variance 25. 07. Excuse me. Under Leland there. Can I get a mover and a second or for that too, please. Mark and Melinda.
Speaker C: Sorry, I just wanted to make sure we're on the. On the right application variance 25. 07. The proposal is to permit a business facial sign to be erected on the north and south side walls of the building that is not facing a public street within as per table 3313 and a business fascia sign having a maximum letter height of 1.09 meters being 3.58ft instead of the required 0.6 meters being 1.97ft as per section 3333 within the MG1 Industrial General Zoning District. This is located at 245 Transport Road in the Southwest Quarter of 1511 4. Mr. Leland on behalf of DAMAC Ventures is requesting council's approval to allow for the signage to have an increased letter height on the on their business fascia signs and the erection of fascia signs on the south and north walls of the existing industrial building. As stated within section 3333. Facial signs shall not have any letters over 0.6 meters being 1.97, 1.97ft in height and which exceed 80% of the building width. Under table 3331 of the zoning bylaws, fascia signs are only permitted on the front wall of a facing a public street. They are proposing a facial sign on the north and south side of the buildings. The letters height will be a maximum of 3.58 based on the site inspection. I have no concerns with the increased letters on the facial sign or the placement of the signs on the north or south sides of the existing building. If council were to consider this variation, I would offer the following Condition number one, that the applicant obtain the required municipal permits. Thank you, Mayor Taryon.
Speaker A: Thank you very much. Rod Leland. Would he be in the audience or online?
Speaker D: Yes. Good evening.
Speaker A: Hey, Rod. You've heard what Dan had to say. Was there anything more you want to add or are you satisfied with what he had to say?
Speaker D: If you have a few minutes, I'd love to speak briefly about our business.
Speaker A: So, your worship, just state your name Rod, for everybody in the chambers here as well.
Speaker D: Certainly. Thank you, your worship. I'm your worship and members of council, I'm Rod Leland. I. I'm the marketing manager for the Commercial group of companies which includes DAMAC Ventures. Thanks for the opportunity to appear and to speak. And also thank you to Mr. Doucet and his team for their work. So Commercial is the largest work truck dealer and manufacturer in the country. Importantly, we're proudly 100% Canadian owned and operated. We're a private company and we supply fire trucks, tow trucks, snowplows, utility trucks, refuse vehicles, crane trucks, road to rail vehicles and more to municipalities, airports and businesses across the country. We very proudly count the city of Winnipeg, Norway House, Cree Nation, Stonewall, East St. Paul and of course the RM Springfield amongst our customers. And we actually recently delivered the RM Springfield's newest wildland firefighting vehicle, Squad 2, which is now hauled at Fire Station 2. Our other newer branches across the country are bold, modern, industrial styled service and production shops. And we would although all the details in our application, we'd appreciate the approval of our variance application so that we can have our new flagship Oak bank facility bear the same branding as them. And if your worship, if you'd permit our branch managers in the gallery there in person, and if it's possible you'd like to speak a little bit about our branch there and his team. Thank you.
Speaker A: Sure. We got a few minutes. Sir, did you want to add more to that?
Speaker H: I'm Chris Kaminski. I'm the branch manager for Commercial Truck equipment who is the resident of the building owned by DAMAC Ventures. So we're undergoing a large expansion which the permitting process has already gone through and the building is well on sway. We're expanding our staff to provide well paying jobs to the RM and the surrounding areas. And part of this variant is to allow us to advertise where we are and who we are, as well as to allow us to have the same continuity of our branches across Canada. We're in multiple locations across Canada, right from B.C. to Ontario.
Speaker A: Okay, thank you very much. Then we'll open it up to the public hearing portion. We'll open it up for those with inquiries online or in the audience. I see nothing. Then I'll open it up to both those in favor and those opposed so and. Or online first. I see nothing. Or in the audience, any questions from council at all? I see nothing with regards to council's questions. Then at this portion here, I'm satisfied that the hearing portion has been met. And then for legal purposes, no further questions will be allowed and the matter is closed then unless there's any questions from council. And I see none. If I can read the variance, please, and then we can vote.
Speaker B: Whereas a public hearing has been conducted under the Planning act to consider an application filed by Rod Leland on behalf of Damac Ventures Limited, owner of the property located at 245 Transport Road, for a variation of the Springfield zoning bylaw number 0801. And whereas council is satisfied that the requirements of Part 6 variances has been met, be it resolved that variation order number 2507 be granted subject to the one condition.
Speaker A: Thank you. With that being read under 2507. Can I get a show of hands, those in support? That is unanimous and it is carried. Then we'll continue back to 5.1. We've already got a mover in a second with regards to that. We are awaiting our CEO to do the review there. And if I can hear from the rc.
Speaker B: Oh, so I did listen to the recording. So the development officer provided his report, and then the applicant asked to defer and counsel agreed to defer. And the evidentiary portion of the hearing was not closed. So the minutes are inaccurate. And then it was noted that we would re advertise the hearing because new information would be available. We weren't sure what meeting we'd be able to reschedule it to.
Speaker A: Okay, but no, no information was heard. Anything as well?
Speaker B: No information was heard.
Speaker A: Okay. Mrs. Nyland, are you still there? Mrs. Nyland?
Speaker C: She's void or she's mute.
Speaker A: I don't even have her on the screen here.
Speaker F: Yes, I'm still here.
Speaker A: Did you hear what our CEO said?
Speaker F: Sure. So that's what I wondered. Because your minutes are now inaccurate. So you're going to have to amend your minutes.
Speaker A: Yes, we will amend the minutes, but thank you very much for picking that up. Any other questions, ma'?
Speaker C: Am?
Speaker F: I guess my only other concern is the order that you're going to proceed. But you're going to go ahead, it seems. Obviously so. No.
Speaker A: Okay. Thank you. Any other inquiries in the audience or online or. I see none. Then I'll open it up for those in favor. In the audience, I see none. Then online, I see none as well. Then I'll open it up for those opposed. And I see none in the audience or none online. Then I'll open it up to any Questions from accounts.
Speaker G: Mr. Mayor.
Speaker A: Oh, you're opposed. Okay, if you just go up to the podium there and state your name, please.
Speaker I: Hey, good evening. My name is Daniel Page. I'm here as a resident from Sunnyside. So I'm speaking in opposition to this rezoning application. So one thing I wanted to bring forward, just because it's a matter of principle, it's my concern naturally whenever we lose as an RM agriculture preserve land. And I look carefully at the documents put forward both in the planning documents, but also in addition, what I've read and what I've heard today. In addition, I looked over the communication that was went over and summarized briefly. I wanted to touch on two points just. Just to reiterate them because I didn't hear anything about them. And that's kind of a concern of mine because it was communicated in agriculture's communication that it was unclear if this was actually necessary by the applicant to have the rezoning done. There should be some sort of threshold. That's at least my view about this is that there should be a threshold. It shouldn't just be a convenience to rezone agriculture preserve land. It should be that there should be a necessity to do so. And I haven't heard anything that. That necessitates that rezoning. And so that's actually in the communication that's on from January 9, 2024. It's also worth noting that I'm concerned that if council were to proceed with this, it might be deemed premature. Again, like I said, I haven't heard anything that say that this is necessary to do. And I think it's important that we maintain agriculture preserve area in the arm of Springfield. It's a part of the heritage of this, this community. In addition, it is also rather important resource in our community. That's all I have to say.
Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you very much. Any questions of Mr. Page? I see none. Thank you, sir. Any others for in opposition? I see none. Oh, mark.
Speaker G: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. A resident asked me to read this into the record. I know the CEO received a copy of this document and they. They couldn't be here tonight. So I'm just doing what they're asking me to do. So it's. It's not necessarily my opinion, but it's there. So if I can read it.
Speaker A: Go ahead.
Speaker G: Okay, it starts.
Speaker A: Good evening.
Speaker G: My name is Edwin Giesbrecht. I'm a resident and taxpayer of Springfield. Due to an event I'M unable to participate in person this evening. I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to one of our elected officials, Councilor Miller, for kindly agreeing to read my statement on behalf in regards to Agenda 5.1 tonight to the Honorable Council and Mayor, I wish to express concerns about tonight's planning meeting agenda, specifically item 5.1 which involves the proposed subdivision of agricultural preserve zoning for employment slash industrial use. This proposed change raises significant concerns about the appropriate use of land designated for agriculture purposes and undermines the principles of responsible land stewardship. The stark contrast in land use is particularly troubling when considering the long term sustainability of our agricultural resources. While I do not intend to challenge the applicant directly, it is essential to emphasize the importance of maintaining the integrity of agriculture lands which are non renewable resources critical to future generations. Shifting focus towards industrial uses in areas traditionally protected as agriculture preserved lands poses a serious threat to these valuable resources. Additionally, I must address the concerning lack of interaction within the Chamber and the decline in public engagement. Had there been an opportunity during the banished question period to address procedural matters within this very application, it is likely that some outstanding issues related to the potential integrity of the hearing could have been addressed. Open dialogue and the ability for the public to address questions have been increasingly restricted in a manner that can only be described as authoritarian. This suppression of community input has significantly reduced public participation, effectively limiting the community's ability to ask important questions of the Council, which undermines both transparency and accountability. Moreover, the small venue and limited time for public input in this hearing present further challenges. While I am confident that our COO and her administration would not wish to mislead any counselor with unfounded or misguided advice and ensure procedural standards are being implemented to the highest of standards. It is essential that all procedural considerations be accurately presented to the Council before any decisions are made. This is essentially important given that an administrative report states On November 21, 2025, Council granted First Reading referencing Agenda Item 5.1. This may be typographical error which now I guess we know, but it has not been adequately scrutinized, raising concerns about the integrity of other aspects of the process. This is no trivial matter. People's lives and futures deserve respect and response of governments governance. Rather, on a broader note, the Administration's previous issue or use of the term equivalency requires attention. The suggestion that agricultural land can be fairly reclassified to employment industrial zoning is a contradiction in terms. Such a reclassification not only misapplies the concept of equivalency, but also misrepresents the core planning principles. The RM's willingness to flip zoning in this matter runs counter to previous declarations regarding responsible land use, raising serious concerns about the consistency and integrity of decision making. I present these concerns to the honorable council in the hope that your decisions will be made with truthfulness and honor, guided by the principles of transparency, accountability and responsible governance, with understanding that I am adverse to the disingenuous flipping of equivalency clearly set out in this hearing. Untoward. Second reading. Thank you.
Speaker A: Thank you. I'll put that down. As opposed then is. Did I miss anybody in the audience or online I see. Ms. Nyla.
Speaker B: Have I been unmuted?
Speaker F: Can you hear me okay? I don't know. Sometimes it pops up that I've been unmuted. I don't know. I guess my concern and opposition to this is the area is being changed from an agricultural use and that will impact a lot of other things on surrounding properties. And I'm particularly concerned about the land drainage in the area. No. Pardon me. First would be the traffic that it'll impact in the area, then the land drainage and possible impacts on groundwater. And I wonder if it would.
Speaker A: Be.
Speaker F: Something that council would consider before they make their decision is to have some studies done on traffic and traffic impact on that area and any drainage and wastewater impacts before you make your decision. So I'm opposed without those studies.
Speaker A: Thank you very much. Any questions from council at all? I see none. I'm satisfied that all the portions with regards to the public has been heard and our agenda package is quite detailed. Then at this point here I'm prepared to close the public hearing portion and no further comments or questions will be allowed at this time.
Speaker F: Time.
Speaker A: Is there any questions from council before we read the the resolution? Mark.
Speaker G: Thank you, Mayor. I of course, as my environmental side has concern with erosion of preserved land, agriculture, valuable agricultural land, not only for that purpose because we've seen the whittling down of of agricultural land and preserve land, quite frankly throughout our municipality and other municipalities across the province, across Canada, across the world and so forth. So how far do we go until it's too late to go back? Actually it is too late to go back, but so there's impacts as has been suggested from other delegations who are opposed. I'm concerned about the flora and the fauna, but more importantly about how we continue to erode the agriculture preserve land within our own community. We have to look in a sincere way in our local environment, not just broadly, but I think there's importance for us to encourage development where development is warranted and, and necessary perhaps. But in this particular case I feel that it's designated as agriculture preserved for a purpose.
Speaker A: And I. That's.
Speaker G: Those are my comments.
Speaker A: Thank you, Councilor Miller. Any other comments from council before we send it off to vote? Since I'm the chair, I have a last comments here. I find this is a well detailed plan. The other plan, the larger section, I will call it phase one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think it's significant here. That's a larger portion. This is a small 17.4 acre lot area to be used right now. I think there's, you know, tons and tons of sand that's on that land right now. So it's. It's contiguous. That's the main word here. It's contiguous to the, to the development there. It's in an ideal spot. It'll serve our community very well. The. The concern with regards to the drainage. Well, that drainage will be. That's part of the agreement that. That has to be satisfied. Transportation has been involved in this and I was going to say a lot with regards to the Ag Preserve. I'm always concerned about Ag Preserve and I think everybody on council is too. But that said, this property here is rather small and Michelle, Herb, you know, she said exactly what I was going to say. But obviously she's got the credentials and she knows the concerns that we all have and I'm all for that. This development going ahead. So if we can read the variance there, the development Plan Amendment Bylaw 2410 for Ag Preserve, Second Reading 5.1 then we can vote on it be it.
Speaker B: Resolved that second reading be given to bylaw number 2411 being a bylaw of the arm of Springfield to redesignate all Those lands under CT 304-15-3331 described as Lot 134 Plan 433 in RCMP within the Southwest Quarter 29104 from Agricultural Preserve area to employment.
Speaker A: Thank you. With that being read, can I get show of hands first for those in support? That'll be Councillor Warren, Deputy Mayor Fuel and Mayor Tarrian. Those opposed, councillors Kaczynski and Miller. And it is so passed. Then this point here we're going. Where did we leave off here at 5.4, 5.5. Can I get a show of hands or mover and a seconder for variance 25 05, 5.5 under the agenda for Reichert Mover in a seconder, please. Melinda and Andy.
Speaker C: We have zoning variance 25 08. The proposal is to permit a front yard setback of 95ft instead of the required 125ft for the construction of an addition to a dwelling unit as per section 8343 within the AR Agricultural Restricted Zoning District. This is located at 67110 PR 212 within the north half of section 1212. 5. The applicant is requesting council's approval to allow for the reduced front yard setback for the Construction of a 900 or sorry. 392 square foot addition to the dwelling unit. The dwelling was constructed in 1961 and has a front yard setback of 95ft which was prior to the current zoning bylaw requirement of the 125 foot front yard setback. The dwelling is currently lawfully non conforming and non conforming building may continue to be in use but the building shall not be enlarged or added to or rebuilt structurally altered as it. Until it is made to conform with the. With the. Let me repeat that. Altered until it is made into a conforming building via this zoning variance. A site inspection was conducted and I did not have any concerns with the new new addition which will maintain the 95 foot front yard setback. The addition will be to the south of the existing dwelling. If council were to consider this variation, I would offer the following two conditions. Number one, that this, that this applicant obtained the required municipal building permits and number two that the applicant obtained the required provincial MI Manitoba infrastructure permit as the dwelling falls within the MI control zone. Thank you Mayor Terran.
Speaker A: Thank you very much. Would the applicant be in the audience? Mr. Reichert, with that red, sir, is there anything you want to add at all? Satisfied with that? Thank you. Then we'll open it up to the public there first for inquiries online and in the audience. See none. Then we'll open it up for those in favor and. Or those opposed. So both categories online and in the audience. Sir. Just state your name as sir. And they got 10 minutes.
Speaker H: Chris Kaminsky. My address is 67097 PR212 so I am the Reichardt's neighbor. No problem with the variance moving forward as my permission.
Speaker A: Thank you very much, sir. Then I don't see anybody else in the audience. Any questions from council before we close this? I see none at this time here. I'm satisfied the public hearing portion has been met and at this point here I'm closing the public hearing. No further questions will be allowed. Then if there's no questions and I see none, we'll read the variance and we can vote.
Speaker B: Whereas a public hearing has been conducted under the Planning act to consider an application filed by David Reichardt and Lisa Smith, owner of the Property located at 67110 PR212 for a variation of the Springfield Zoning Bylaw Number 0801. Whereas Council is satisfied that the requirements of Part 6 variances has been met. Be it resolved that variation order number 2508 be granted subject to the two conditions.

You're happy with that? Okay then at this point here we're going to open it up to the the public portion for those inquiries online and in the audience and I see none. Then once again I'll open it up for those in favor and or those opposed. So both categories online and in the audience and I see none. Any questions from Council at all and I see none there as well. I'm happy with the councillor Miller had raised. Oh, go ahead, Mark.
Speaker G: Oh, thank you, Mr. Mayor. First off, I want to welcome this potential business to our community. I think it's long overdue. I had an instance where on.  
Speaker A: New.
Speaker G: Year's Eve I had a freeze up and I had to search readily for septic cleanout operators and I, I, I was actually appalled at the amount that they were charging for an emergency pump out. It was something like $600 but if it wasn't for that our basement would have flooded with sewage backing up. But having said that, I'm glad that there's going to be somebody frankly more local that perhaps we can depend on. I canvass the area extensively and unfortunately there wasn't that. So I'm very optimistic and encourage you to strive forth and hopefully you'll get to the two traps two trucks sooner than you even want to.
Speaker A: Any other questions or comments from council? I see none. Then at this time here I'm satisfied the public hearing portion has been met and no further question will be allowed for legal reasons and prepared to close the public hearing. So if I can get the reading.
Speaker B: And we can vote as a public hearing has been conducted under the Planning act to consider an application filed by Camera Unra and Rachel Harder, owners of the property located at 4100 Oakwood Road for a conditional use under the Springfield zoning bylaw number 0801.

Speaker G: For clarity, I noticed here that the owner is actually my niece's husband. So I'm more than ready to excuse myself for this vote. I'm not sure how that applies, but I don't want to be seen in a conflict. But I'm more than happy to excuse myself.
Speaker A: I personally don't think that would be an issue, but I'll.
Speaker B: Yeah, if you feel there's financial benefit to you approving this, then that would be something you could take.
Speaker A: Okay. Just for the record, Councilor Miller has left the room just for being a conflict here and perceived or otherwise.
Speaker C: I will continue with my report. Mr. Buffy is requesting council's approval to permit an automotive and recreational vehicle sales business within Unit 4 at 2071 Plessy Road.

There are five spaces at the rear for employee parking as well for employee vehicles. At the time of the site inspection, it was observed that unit four was vacant. And I have no concerns with this proposed proposed business operation. If council were to consider this conditional use, I would offer the following conditions. Number one, a development permit be obtained for the signage related to the business. Number two, this order shall expire and become null and void on the date the business ceases to be in operation. And number three, this order shall not be transferable to any other owner and or lessee.

Speaker A: Thank you, Mr. Doucet. There would Mr. Charles Liu be in the audience or online? I don't see. Oh, Buffy. Sorry. Apologize for that. Would he be in line and I don't see him been present. Then if I can get for the public portion for inquiries on online and in the audience. I see none. Then we'll open it up for those in favor and or those opposed together. And there's nothing online? No. Or online or in the audience.

Whereas council is satisfied that the requirements of Part 7 conditional uses has been met be it resolved that conditional use order number 25 to 10 be granted.
Speaker A: Subject to the three conditions with conditional use red. Can I get a show of hands those in support? Councillor Warren Kaczynski Fuel and Tarian. Constable Miller has abstained from from the vote there and it is carried. And then we'll move on to item 6.1, the last on our agenda here. And we'll just wait for Councilor Miller to come back here. Actually, can I get a mover and a second or for this as well? Glenn and Melinda. Thanks. Okay, so we have a mover intersector for 6.1. That's a proposal to subdivide the request for caveat removal under a long number for 25022 open under meanan. Wonder if I can get Dan to speak to this. And then we proceed.
Speaker C: I'll give counsel a quick brief. This is not a public hearing. What we have Mr. Minan had. Mr. And Mrs. Minan had provided me with a formal request to go before council for a full discharge of a registered caveat which is caveated to certificate of title number 3301-501-Winnipeg land titles. The development agreement was an agreement between the municipality and the Minans. The municipal and Northern relations were not party to this agreement. The registered caveat was placed on title back on June 3, 2024. The development agreement restricted any residential buildings, excluding agricultural buildings. The development agreement was a condition imposed by municipal and Northern relations as condition number three listed within their conditional approval letter relating to a subdivision application. Below is an Excerpt from the Municipal Northern Relations Council referral letter back on November 22, 2023, which was attached to council. Also, please note that council did not include the development agreement as a condition of the resolution of Council 23. 4, 7, 3. Sorry. 4, 7, 9. Which is part of the report. So what Mr. Minan had done originally with the application, they had severed their parcel of land which they were splitting 30. 30 acres off for specialized agriculture. And then there's the residual parcel of agricultural land. If council were to consider approving the request for the full discharge, I had the following resolution drafted, but it's totally under council's discretion and consideration. Mr. Minan is here in the gallery as well, if the council has any questions. Thank you, Mayor Tarian.
Speaker A: Thank you. Daniel. Minan would. Is there anything else you want to add there, Dan? But Mr. Doucet hasn't mentioned. Okay, thank you very much. Any questions from council at all? I see none. Then I'm prepared to have it read, and then we can vote on it.
Speaker B: Just to clarify, Ms. Nyland, this is not a public hearing.
Speaker A: Go ahead. I'm.
Speaker F: I'm not. I guess my point is the.
Speaker A: This isn't a public hearing.
Speaker F: I. I understand that. It's a. It's a point of order, Mr. Mayor. It. It reads as. It's a proposal to subdivide. It's not a proposal to subdivide. So I guess I was thinking that's what we were doing. There's no further subdivision. What you're doing is now a council action after a subdivision. So the point of order is that you're now removing a caveat that was put on an agreement a short while ago. And I'm just wondering if those that spoke at that time have been consulted about removing that agreement.
Speaker A: Agreement, Dan? I don't think we required to do that.
Speaker C: This originally was a subdivision that was proposed before council, and the request now is the removal of the caveat. No, this did not get circulated to any of the surrounding landowners, nor was it a requirement. This was an agreement that was placed on by the provincial government within their conditional approval. They are not party to the agreement. Municipal and Northern relations. They forced council to enter into this agreement. Now Mr. Minan is asking for the discharge of this. It's up to council if they wish to discharge it or not.
Speaker A: Thank you. Any questions from my council at all? Andy? Yes, Mr. Mind. So what, you're actually asking to remove this caveat for what? The purpose? So somebody come and can build the house on this property? No, not yet. Dan, can you answer that?
Speaker C: What Mr. Minan's intent is?
Speaker A: Yeah, so I'm thinking about the policies and so on like that. Is that something that you can ask or maybe Dan can answer better.
Speaker C: The rationale why he wants to discharge or why the caveat was placed on the property?
Speaker A: Well, the caveat that would be something that you can answer.
Speaker C: I can answer the caveat why it was placed. Manitoba Agriculture did want. Did not want multiple houses within the area. So they place the development on there. I understand that Mr. Minan is trying to sell the property. Some of the farmers are not even looking at the property. If they can't even put a farmstead dwelling on on that site. You can ask Mr. Minan as he's been dealing with real estate agents directly.
Speaker A: Councillor Kaczynski, does that answer your question there or is it something else? Well, how is this land rezoned now?
Speaker C: How is it zoned right now? It's owned agricultural. Agricultural preserve.
Speaker A: So it preserve agricultural land? Yeah. So only the building that could be allowed there.
Speaker G: It's a farm building?
Speaker A: Farm building, yeah. Okay, thank you. Any other questions? Then if we can read the caveat.
Speaker B: Be resolved that a full discharge be granted for caveat number 564-421-51 from Lot 2, Plan 73464 under CT 3301-501 within part of Northwest Quarter 20115 subject to the following condition. The applicant shall be responsible for the $200 municipal fee, all legal expenses and all property registry charges for the full discharge of said KVs.
Speaker A: Yet then if. I'll put it out to the vote from council. Those in the in support? That'll be Councillor Warren Miller, Councilor Fuel and Tarian. Those opposed? Councillor Kaczynski. And it is so passed. Then adjournment. Can I get a mover in a second or two? Adjourn. That's Mark and Glenn. And it is solo adjourned at 7:28pm thank you. Take care there, Dan.
